# Software Package Guide

At C42 we work with prepared installations for our team that contain different packages of software depending on the role of the team member. Within this setup, both Mac and Ubuntu are supported. This guide is constantly updated to keep up-to-date with the agile software world. These updates are reflected in the [changenotes](#make-me-work).


## The different software packages
