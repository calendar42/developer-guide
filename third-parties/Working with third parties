# Working with third parties

C42 is starting to work a lot with third parties developers. This document is trying to define a guidelines for that relations.

## Prerequisites

> A list of prerequisites that will prepare our teams to work together in a proper way.

* The delivery product should be completely defined before to start coding.
* The technical requirements should be totally defined and accepted for both sides (third partie and C42) before start the implementation. This includes:
  * Technologies used.
  * Communication protocols and channels.
  * Code guidelines.
  * Delivery process.
* The code sharing platform used will be [Github](https://github.com) through the [C42 Private repositories](https://github.com/calendar42). Before to start C42 should create the repository to use.
* The App should be non costumer related. This should be taken in consideration during the App and code design process.

## Working process:

> We all develop, we all love our work. Let's try to make it easy and enjoy of the way.

1. Definition.
